Plugins have access to **Hooks** and **Events**, two separate ways of dealing with the data associated with the various actions and mutations that Flint employs.

## Hooks

Different from events, **Hooks** are fired at specific times in a model's lifecycle and can affect the data before it is changed or saved in the database. For more information on hooks, you can check out the [Mongoose docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html#pre).

### Adding a Hook

```js
class MyPlugin extends FlintPlugin {
  // ...

  init(schema, events) {
    if (schema.name === 'User') {
      schema.pre('validate', function (next) {
        if (this.name.first !== 'John') {
          next(new Error(`Your name is ${this.name.first}, but this website is only for people named John.`));
        } else {
          next();
        }
      });
    }
  }
}
```

## Events

An event is fired before and after each GraphQL mutation. Note that events are just a way of informing your plugin of when something has happened, not a way of affecting the data associated with the event. That's what hooks are for! You can listen for these events through the second argument of your plugin's `init` method:

```js
class MyPlugin extends FlintPlugin {
  // ...

  init(schema, events) {
    events.on('post-new-entry', (entry) => {
      console.log('This entry was just saved!', entry);
    });
  }
}
```
