Assets are, for now, images. These images are stored in the local file system on the server. When you upload a new asset, it is saved to the `/public/assets/` folder of your server. There is a special static route to the public folder as a part of the Flint server, so when linking to an asset in a template you'll want to do something like:

```html
<img src="/public/assets/myimage.png" />
```

Future plans to improve assets includes adding more available file types and categorization (like sub-folders). If you want to help improve FlintCMS in this way, please [talk about it here]({{ site.github_repo }}/issues)!
