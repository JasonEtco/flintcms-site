Fields are the ways that your writers or content editors can fill in the spaces given to them in a section. For example, you might have a field that is a simple text input called *Subtitle*, then just below it, you could have a Rich Text field called *Main Content*. This is a common pattern to represent two individual bits of content that, due to their individual template handles, can be styled and layed out completely separately.

Fields can be reused throughout multiple sections and each come with customizable options to ensure that your content is consistent.
