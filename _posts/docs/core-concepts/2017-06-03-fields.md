Fields are the ways that your writers or content editors can fill in the spaces given to them in a section. For example, you might have a field that is a simple text input called **Subtitle**, then just below it, you could have a Rich Text field called **Main Content**. This is a common pattern to represent two individual bits of content that, due to their individual template handles, can be styled and laid out completely separately (or together, it's up to you!).

Fields can be reused throughout multiple sections and each come with customizable options to ensure that your content is consistent.

## Field Types

There are a number of different field types that you can use.

* Asset
* Checkboxes
* Color
* Date
* Dropdown
* Group
* Number
* Rich Text
* Text
* Toggle

### Group Type

The Group field type allows you to group fields together into repeatable, modular pieces. They work in `Blocks` which are individual groups of fields. Every field type can be nested within a Group field's blocks. It can be a little bit complicated to get your head around, but the complexity is necessary for the customizability that the Group field offers.
