Unlike other content management systems, Flint comes with unlimited usergroups for free. This means that as far as templating goes, there is only one type of user with potentially different usergroups (which makes templating easy to plan for).

Every time the server is restarted, Flint checks to see if there is an Admin usergroup and, if necessary, creates one with all permission enabled. Deleting the Admin usergroup is disabled on the dashboard, but in case someone does it by mistake directly through the database or some other horrible mistake happens, Flint has you covered.

## Public Registration

Some websites need for their users to be able to signup for the site, rather than being given an account. In your Flint site's settings (under `Settings/Site Settings`) you can enable or disable the endpoints that allow for form or AJAX inputs.
