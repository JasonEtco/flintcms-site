Entries are really the meat and potatoes of Flint. You can think of them as posts or articles, but they are effectively the individual documents that your website has. Entries are grouped within Sections to maintain the same styling and content expectations.

Entries can have one of three statuses: `Live`, `Draft` or `Disabled`. Live is fairly straightforward, but Draft and Disabled are separate to enable more specific user permissions.

Because entries are the main way that content is added to your site, there are specific permissions that deal with them. For example, there is a permission that enables/disables the ability to create or edit a live entry.
