## Site Properties

### `siteName`
The name of your website

### `siteUrl`
Your website's url. Note that this may not be reliable as it checks your configuration settings, not where the server is actually running.

### `style`
A string of CSS code that can be changed through the admin dashboard. Useful for small changes to templates that can be made without cloning/editing the codebase.
