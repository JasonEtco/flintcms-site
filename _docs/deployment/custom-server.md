Want to run your FlintCMS server on a server? [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) is a commonly used server-as-a-service, and works well with Node.js applications. They have a great tutorial on [setting up a Node.js application for production](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04) that you can check out. FlintCMS has been tested on a DigitalOcean droplet, so it should all work as expected. If you have any problems, please [open up an issue here]({{ site.github_repo }}/issues)!

> DigitalOcean isn't the only server service out there. You can use AWS too!
