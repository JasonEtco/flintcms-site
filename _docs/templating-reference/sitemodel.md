## Site Properties

### `siteName`
The name of your website

### `siteUrl`
Your website's URL. Note that this may not be reliable as it checks your configuration settings, not where the server is actually running.

### `style`
A string of CSS code that can be changed through the admin dashboard. Useful for small changes to templates that can be made without cloning/editing the codebase.

### `cssHash`
A random hash that was generated by Flint's [cache busting system](/docs/cache-busting). You'll probably want to use it like:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% raw %}main-{{ flint.site.cssHash }}.css{% endraw %}">
```
